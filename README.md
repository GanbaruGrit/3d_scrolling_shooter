## What it is:
---

This prototype is being created as a take on the classic vertically scrolling arcade shoot'em up genre. It utilizes a unique dual camera system where the playfield is rendered by an initial camera which is set on a scroll path and triggers elements such as a enemy spawns. The second camera is setup with a 3rd person chase rig and follows a dolly path through an environment which then renders behind the first camera.

This game is being developed as a full vertical slice for potential publisher consideration. As such, there's fully implemented systems for expanding on all core prefabs so that additional enemies, shot patterns, and environments can all be quickly created streamlining the process in the future.
